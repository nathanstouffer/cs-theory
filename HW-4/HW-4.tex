\section*{Problem 1}

Let ${\cal B}$ be the set of all infinite sequences over $\{a,b\}$. Show that
${\cal B}$ is uncountable, using a proof by diagonalization. \\

\noindent
{\bf Proof: } We prove that ${\cal B}$ is uncountable by contradiction, that is, we assume that ${\cal B}$ is countable. Since ${\cal B}$ is countable, we know there exists a bijective map \\ 
$f: {\cal B} \longrightarrow {\cal N}$. We now construct an element $b \in {\cal B}$ that violates the surjective property of $f$, that is, there exists no $n \in {\cal N}$ such that $f(n) = b$. \parspace
For $i \in {\cal N}$, let $f(i) = a$. We then choose $b_i \neq a_i$ (where $*_i$ means the $i^{th}$ element of $*$). To be explicit, if $a_i = a$, then $b_i = b$. Alternatively, if $a_i = b$, then $b_i = a$. \parspace
We have now constructed $b \in {\cal B}$ (the Codomain) such that there exists no $n \in {\cal N}$ (the Domain) where $f(n) = b$. This means that the map $f$ is no longer surjective. Thus, in assuming that ${\cal B}$ is countable, we have encountered a contradiction. So it must be the case that ${\cal B}$ is uncountable.

\section*{Problem 2}

Let $T=\{ (i,j,k) \mid i,j,k \in {\cal N} \}$. Show that $T$ is countable. \\

\noindent
{\bf Proof: } To show that $T$ is countable, we must give a bijection $f : {\cal N} \longrightarrow T$.
